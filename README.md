# Boing

Boing is an application that will help keep track of options trades by 
displaying user inputted floors, ceilings, and strikes and will measure how far each price level is from the underlying's current price. 

Boing will keep track of user's calculated buy prices and valuations for equities and calculate how overvalue or undervalued the equity is.
